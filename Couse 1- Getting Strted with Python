**********Course 1 -Getting Started with Python *************

Week 4
Assignment 2.3

Question :
            Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. 
            Use 35 hours and a rate of 2.75 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 96.25). 
            You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. 
            Do not worry about error checking or bad user data.

Output : 
          Pay : 96.25
          
Solution :
            hrs = input("Enter Hours:")
            r = input("Enter the rate : ")
            rate=float(r)
            hour=float(hrs)
            pay=rate*hour
            print("Pay:",pay)
Week 5

Assignment 3.3 

Question :
           Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. 
           If the score is out of range, print an error. 
           If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:
            Score Grade
            >= 0.9 A
            >= 0.8 B
            >= 0.7 C
            >= 0.6 D
            < 0.6 F
            If the user enters a value out of range, print a suitable error message and exit. For the test, enter a score of 0.85.
            
Output : 
            B
  
Solution :
            s =input("Enter Score: ")
            score = float(s)
            if(score>=0.9):
                        print("A")
            elif(score>=0.8):       
                        print("B")
            elif (score>=0.7):
	            print("C")
            elif(score>=0.6):
	            print("D")
            elif(score<0.6):
	            print("F")
            else :
	            print("Error")

Week 6 

Assignment 4.6 
	
Question:	Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. 
		Pay should be the normal rate for hours up to 40 and time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. 
		Put the logic to do the computation of pay in a function called computepay() and use the function to do the computation.
		The function should return a value. Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75). 
		You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. 
		Do not worry about error checking the user input unless you want to - you can assume the user types numbers properly.
		Do not name your variable sum or use the sum() function.
		
Output :
		498.75

Solution :
		def computepay(h,r):
   		 if(h<=40):
       		 pay=h*r
   		 else:
      			  pay=((h-40)*1.5*r)+(40*r)
   		 return pay
    		 hrs = input("Enter Hours:")
		 h=float(hrs)
		 rate=input("Enter rate :")
		 r=float(rate)
		 pay=computepay(h,r)
		 print(pay)

Week 7 

Assignment 5.2

Question : Write a program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until the user enters 'done'. Once 'done' is entered,
	   print out the largest and smallest of the numbers. 
	   If the user enters anything other than a valid number catch it with a try/except and put out an appropriate message and
	   ignore the number. 
	   Enter 7, 2, bob, 10, and 4 and match the output
	   
Output : Invalid input
	Maximum is 10
	Minimum is 2
	
Solution :
		largest = None
		smallest = None
		while True:
    		try:
      			  num = raw_input("Enter a number: ")
        		  if num == "done":
            		  break
       			  num = int(num)
        		  if largest is None or largest < num:
           			 largest = num
        		  elif smallest is None or smallest > num:
            			 smallest = num
   		except ValueError:
        		  print("Invalid input")
 	
			 print ("Maximum is", largest)
			 print ("Minimum is", smallest)
