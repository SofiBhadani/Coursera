Question :
Data Files

We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the sum for your testing and the other is the actual data you need to process for the assignment.

    Sample data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/regex_sum_42.txt (There are 90 values with a sum=445833)
    Actual data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/regex_sum_280454.txt (There are 84 values and the sum ends with 348)

These links open in a new window. Make sure to save the file into the same folder as you will be writing your Python program. Note: Each student will have a distinct data file for the assignment - so only use your own data file for analysis.

Data Format

The file contains much of the text from the introduction of the textbook except that random numbers are inserted throughout the text. Here is a sample of the output you might see:

Why should you learn to write programs? 7746
12 1929 8827
Writing programs (or programming) is a very creative 
7 and rewarding activity.  You can write programs for 
many reasons, ranging from making your living to solving
8837 a difficult data analysis problem to having fun to helping 128
someone else solve a problem.  This book assumes that 
everyone needs to know how to program ...

The sum for the sample text above is 27486. The numbers can appear anywhere in the line. There can be any number of numbers in each line (including none).

Handling The Data

The basic outline of this problem is to read the file, look for integers using the re.findall(), looking for a regular expression of '[0-9]+' and then converting the extracted strings to integers and summing up the integers. 




Output:
        Enter the sum from the actual data and your Python code below:
         The sum of the digits end with 348



Source Code :
            import re
            fhandle = open('regex_sum_279468.txt')
            numlist = list()
            for line in fhandle:
             line = line.rstrip()
   
             num = re.findall('[0-9]+', line)
             if len(num) < 1:
              continue

              elif len(num) == 1:
                  # 5. Convert strings to integers
                  num1 = int(num[0])
                  numlist.append(num1)
              elif len(num) == 2:
                  num1 = int(num[0])
                  num2 = int(num[1])
                  numlist.append(num1)
                  numlist.append(num2)
              else:
                  num1 = int(num[0])
                  num2 = int(num[1])
                  num3 = int(num[2])
                  numlist.append(num1)
                  numlist.append(num2)
                  numlist.append(num3)
          sum_num_int = sum(numlist)
          print len(numlist)
          print sum_num_int
